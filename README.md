**Predicting Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Success**

This project aims to predict the successful landing of SpaceX's Falcon 9 first stage after rocket launch. 

**Background:**

SpaceX has revolutionized space travel by significantly reducing launch costs. A key factor in their cost-effectiveness is the reusability of the Falcon 9 first stage. Successful landings enable significant cost savings, estimated at over $60 million per launch compared to competitors. 

**Objectives:**

* **Data Acquisition & Wrangling:** 
    * Collect launch data from SpaceX's website using web scraping. 
    * Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
    * Transform data into a suitable format for machine learning.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Conduct in-depth analysis of launch data to identify trends, patterns, and potential factors influencing landing success.
    * Visualize data using various plots (scatter plots, bar charts, etc.) to gain insights.
* **Interactive Data Visualization:**
    * Develop an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash to explore launch records and visualize key metrics.
    * Create an interactive map using Folium to analyze launch site proximity and visualize landing locations.
* **Predictive Modeling:**
    * Build and train machine learning models (SVM, Classification Trees, Logistic Regression) to predict landing success.
    * Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
    * Evaluate model accuracy using appropriate metrics and select the best-performing model.

**Potential Applications:**

* **Cost Estimation:** Predict launch costs based on landing success probability.
* **Competitive Analysis:** Provide valuable insights to companies competing with SpaceX in the launch market.
* **Mission Planning:** Assist in mission planning by predicting and mitigating potential risks associated with landing.
